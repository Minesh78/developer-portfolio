      "Hey there! So, I used to be a chemical engineer, but I made a big change and switched to the tech industry. It was a leap of faith, but I've always loved problem-solving and innovation. My foundation in chemical engineering gave me a unique perspective in tech. I immersed myself in coding, took courses, and learned fast. It wasn't always easy at all. Now, I'm inspiring others to embrace technology. It's been an incredible journey, and I'm grateful for every step. In the end, it's all about adaptability, seizing opportunities, and following your passion.",
